# Tipsy

The Tipsy module provides for the use of a jQuery plugin for creating 
a Facebook-like tooltips effect to textareas, textfield, anchors or 
any other HTML element you specify.

This is an incomplete port of the Drupal module of the same name. 

## Status

This module is work-in-progress and will not yet work as intended.


## Installation

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.
  
- also download and install as a library the jquery.tipsy.js which
  is available from https://github.com/jaz303/Tipsy.
  
## Configuration

- Configuration settings are at admin/config/content/tipsy. There you
  can provide settings for two uses:
  
  + settings that will provide tips for all forms in the site
  
  + custom settings for one or more class selectors.



## Help & Documentation

See readme.txt for more information about the background to
this module. Also see detail about the jQuery plugin at
